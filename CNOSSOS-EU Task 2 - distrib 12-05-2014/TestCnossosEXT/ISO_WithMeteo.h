 * author:		dirk.van-maercke@cstb.fr
 * copyright:	see file licence.EU.txt
 * description:	implements a user-defined ISOWithMeteo calculation method
 *
 * rationale:	the ISO method allows calculation for a single "moderately favorable" propagation
 *			    condition. This value is then used to derive a long-time averaged noise level
 *              by means of a C0 correction term. C0 is defined by the end-user or by local
 *				authorities. In some countries/regions, a published method exist to link C0
 *			    to local weather statistics. 
 *
 *				However, the C0 method has two major pitfalls: first,it is a constant for all 
 *				propagation directions and secondly (and more important), it does not take into 
 *				account the nature of the ground. It is a well known fact that favorable propagation 
 *				conditions mainly destroy ground effect (i.e. the destructive interference of a 
 *				direct and a ground-reflected ray path that occurs under homogeneous propagation 
 *				conditions). Therefore, the effects of meteorological conditions are much larger 
 *				over soft ground than over hard ground and appropriate C0 values should be used 
 *				accordingly.
 *
 *				This is an attempt to overcome the above mentioned difficulties by letting 
 *				the ISO method making an estimate of the attenuation under favorable propagation 
 *				conditions. The frequency of occurrence of favorable and unfavorable propagation 
 *				conditions can then be taken into account similarly to the French NMPB methods. 
 *				Note that the frequency of occurrence of favorable propagation conditions can be 
 *				evaluated in a well defined way from historical recordings of meteorological data 
 *				(e.g. from the ERA40 database) and this process can easily be automated for all 
 *				European countries.
